This works intends to analyse packing algorithms on 3dimensional objects on a bi-dimensional plane, searching for efficient ways to storage objects and packing on non-rectangular boards.
It will make use of a modeling software called FreeCad and Its integration with Python to work with packing algorithms.
Where It will analyze different genetic algorithms implementations comparing how they converge to a near-optimal result.
